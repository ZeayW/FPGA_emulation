# Xilinx physical flow

This document describes the public contract of EmuFlow's Xilinx physical
backend, including the implementation stages and their acceptance criteria.

## Backend contract

The physical backends publish the same high-level result contract while using
different device models and implementation engines:

| Backend | Device model and implementation |
| --- | --- |
| RapidWright | Supported Xilinx device resources and site/BEL connectivity, native OpenPARF placement, validated site/BEL binding, and RWRoute detailed routing |
| VTR | VTR architecture XML, VPR packing and routing-resource graph, and either OpenPARF or VPR placement |
| Vivado | Optional vendor synthesis and implementation integration for supported inputs |

RapidWright device data describes a device, not the multi-FPGA board around it.
Board topology, fixed package-pin connections, link capacity, and inter-FPGA
latency come from the separate [hardware platform model](HARDWARE_PLATFORM.md).

## Placement preparation

Phase 7 maps the split netlist and generated transport logic to the selected
device model. Ordinary high-fanout nets in the transport design are converted
to deterministic balanced LUT1 buffer trees before native OpenPARF placement.
Clock and reset networks keep their dedicated handling. The added LUTs remain
subject to the same per-FPGA resource limits as all other cells.

The mapped SQLite exporter retains primary-key and pin constraints during
insertion, then bulk-builds the auxiliary pin indexes before atomic publication.
No consumer can observe a partially indexed netlist. This avoids per-pin random
updates to the net-order index during large physical input generation.

For mapped index v2, `emuflow_xilinx_bookshelf_exporter` reads the typed cell,
pin, and validated atom relations directly. C++ checks atom ownership and types,
contiguous port bits, pin directions, and multiple drivers, then streams nets in
numeric net order with drivers first. Constants remain in primitive pin
signatures but do not become net endpoints; single-endpoint nets are omitted.
Only primitive pin signatures and aggregate counts return to Python, which
renders the small library and atomically publishes the net file. The exporter
opens its frozen input relations with explicit immutable read-only URIs and
uses the SQLite 3.22+ development library at build time. Materialized JSON callers
retain the reference exporter for explicit compatibility and differential tests.
This removes one graph-sized Python traversal; mapped lowering, physical macro
preparation, and timing-query preparation are separate stages.

Atomic-source construction, Bookshelf export, and placement validation reuse
the physical macro derivation owned by the same live immutable mapped reader.
Consumers receive detached records, so modifying one returned contract cannot
change later validation. Closing the reader releases this derived state. A new
reader, a different mapped file/top, or a mutable JSON input derives its own
facts; no persistent analysis artifact or cross-run cache is introduced.

The native SLL multiplier keeps OpenPARF's `[0,1000)` acceptance policy and
uses the fixed `t_psi=0.002` Adam step from LEAPS Equation (23). This is the
incremental component of the former `1.002` exponential growth rate, rather
than that rate itself. The current SLL-count delta receives the paper's
`rho=0.9` EMA weight before entering the Adam moments. Applying the absolute
delta again as an exponential factor makes the update depend exponentially on
design size. Oversize positive updates are rejected and negative updates clamp
at zero without disabling SLL optimization or relaxing placement checks.

OpenPARF applies a bounded square-root weight to large nets in its analytical
placement objective. This guides placement without changing connectivity.
The preferred logic-filler row limit may be exceeded when necessary to keep
each LUT/FF filler within half a density bin. Native startup validates the
actual filler count, size, bin size, and span, and the convergence certificate
records those values. Preserving total filler area alone is insufficient:
coarse samples alias the density field and can leave overflow flat while the
placement multipliers diverge. For square logic fillers, the half-bin bound
requires about four times the sampling rows of the former full-bin bound.
Exact legalization and an independent site/BEL validator remain responsible
for physical legality.

Global-placement overflow is an analytical quality signal, not a site/BEL
legality rule. The normal pass target is `0.10`. When the optimizer reaches a
stable candidate between `0.10` and `0.25`, the representative diagnostic path
restores the lowest-HPWL bounded checkpoint and runs DirectLG. Its certificate
records mean and maximum legalization displacement, post-legalization HPWL,
and exact legality. A diagnostic handoff does not authorize routing by itself;
the placement and initial congestion evidence must be reviewed first.
The diagnostic patience window is measured from the last improvement to the
best bounded HPWL. A smaller analytical overflow alone does not reset it,
because the density multiplier can otherwise keep reducing overflow while
wirelength and SLL cost diverge.

The conservative UltraScale+ model qualifies eight independent 6LUT BELs and
sixteen FF BELs per slice. DirectLG retains sixteen LUT z positions to encode
the 5LUT/6LUT pairs, with paired LUT use disabled. That encoding is not physical
density capacity: each analytical LUT consumes `1/8` of a slice, each FF `1/16`.
The density headroom check and filler count use the same qualified capacity.
The `resource_unit_capacity` manifest field records these density units; the
Bookshelf site grammar retains sixteen LUT slots for native BEL numbering.
This leaves the configured target density and final site/BEL checks intact.

Bookshelf's column grammar stretches each site to the next entry. The exporter
therefore inserts zero-resource entries after a logic site when physical gaps
or reserved rows follow it. LUT/FF sites occupy one native grid row; hard-block
spans keep their qualified heights. These unavailable entries are not physical
sites and never appear in the atom-to-site database. The driver compares the
already constructed native density tensors with the exported LUT/FF site-area
totals before optimization. Missing or mismatched area contracts fail closed;
regenerate native inputs when continuing from an older configuration.

The OpenPARF coordinate importer joins solver rows to the authenticated atomic
name-map sidecar through an explicitly URI-enabled SQLite connection. The
sidecar is attached read-only and immutable; the join independently checks atom
identity and exact coverage without expanding the complete name map in Python.

The default placement region covers all SLRs of the device. The platform's
per-FPGA utilization limit is a whole-device capacity contract and does not
implicitly create a pblock. Using the whole device lets the placer trade
wirelength for lower local density and better routability.

## Detailed routing and validation

The validated placement is passed to RWRoute. Routing is complete only when
all required connections are routed, no capacity overlap remains between
different nets, and the independent route certificate can resolve every
covered logical net to its physical nodes and PIPs. Iteration diagnostics
include congested connections, overused-node counts, excess users, maximum
occupancy, and SLR distribution.

Clock-region capacity, clock-tree legality, ordinary-net legality, and route
coverage are separate checks. Passing a coarse clock-region capacity audit is
necessary when that audit applies, but it does not by itself certify complete
clock routing or clock timing.

## Fixed differential I/O

Phase 7 consumes the sealed Phase 6 binding, differential adapter, and XDC
files. Each used virtual-board lane must resolve to the same top-level port,
P/N package pins, bank, direction, and schedule entry recorded by Phase 6.
The RapidWright adapter materializes the corresponding differential I/O
boundary and includes it in route coverage and boundary timing.

A mismatch between the wiring inventory, binding, generated RTL, or XDC is a
hard failure. The resulting route validates the declared research platform;
electrical board signoff still requires the real board's power, clock, reset,
connector, termination, and signal-integrity constraints.

## Timing publication

Per-FPGA physical timing records logic and interface delays from the routed
implementation. EmuFlow then binds those delays to the selected TDM events and
BoardDB link-delay model for global analysis. OpenSTA is the default global STA
engine. Its WNS/TNS values are meaningful only for the declared TimingPathDB
population and the sealed physical/platform inputs described in the
[global timing qualification](global-opensta-qualification.md).

Passing partition resource checks, placement legality, or routing alone does
not establish whole-design timing closure. Phase 7 publishes a successful
whole-design result only after every selected FPGA record and the global timing
contract pass their independent validators.

## Vivado indexed provider

The optional `vivado` backend consumes the current compact Phase 6 split and
transport contracts. It streams native Xilinx primitives through the canonical
mapped SQLite index into RTL, then runs Vivado synthesis, optimization,
placement, physical optimization, and routing in out-of-context (OOC) mode.
Fixed data pads are implemented, while external clock sources remain abstract;
absolute clock insertion/skew and board signoff are not qualified. This scope
is retained in each physical result and its summary projection. The retired whole-EmuIR adapter
remains only for explicit legacy inputs. This integration is undergoing
real-device qualification; unit tests alone do not establish routed or global
STA success.

The provider uses the Phase 6 sealed differential adapter and XDC through a
physical wrapper. Post-route checks require exact P/N package pins,
IOSTANDARD, IBUFDS/OBUFDS ownership (including Vivado's native DIFFINBUF/IBUFCTRL
decomposition), complete mapped-cell identity/type coverage,
zero unrouted nets, and zero blocking DRC violations. Native mapped primitives
are initially preserved with KEEP/DONT_TOUCH to retain source-bound timing
identities. No placement LOC/BEL or implicit pblock is imposed. This identity
policy limits optimization across primitives and may affect timing quality.
Whole-device resource budgets also apply to the final physical cell population.

Same-FPGA timing queries cover the complete declared original-path population;
cross-FPGA logic and interface queries retain the Phase 6 identities. Fixed
logical transport ports resolve to the declared physical P pad. Query extents
are checked against actual timing endpoints; a sequential Q launch may start
at the same primitive's clock to include clock-to-Q, while an unrelated prefix
or any suffix beyond the requested endpoint is rejected. The
indexed provider does not use the legacy sampled Vivado TimingPathDB as terminal
evidence. Per-FPGA vendor WNS/TNS describe vendor endpoint constraints; global
original-path WNS/TNS still require the separate complete OpenSTA composition.

Use an installed Vivado with the exact part database and a valid synthesis and
implementation license. `EMUFLOW_VIVADO_THREADS` controls the recorded thread
limit (default 2). All generated files, checkpoints, and temporary tool files
belong to the selected output directory and experiment scratch lifecycle.
`scripts/validation/qualify_vivado_indexed.py` exercises a small three-clock,
four-differential-pair implementation on XCVU19P. Its default `Quick` placement
directive is specific to this smoke test; the production provider remains
`Default`. Its result explicitly covers
synthetic physical/provider qualification only.
